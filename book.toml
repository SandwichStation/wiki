# Redirects
# These are used to map between old Wiki.js links and current docs site links,
# so we can avoid the hell that was dead links with the old hackmd transfer.
# Wiki.js doesn't have `.html` endings on files, so we hack it by putting /index.html
# and just letting the browser look there, then get redirected
